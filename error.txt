1)Uncaught Error: Returned values aren't valid, did it run Out of Gas?
	this can also happen when the MNEMONIC value from Ganache is different from the one you have in your truffle.js or truffle-config.js file.
	sol: migrate contract into truffle develop to call get function


2)contract has not been deployed to detected network (network/artifact mismatch)
	sol:I found my problem was that the metamask was on the wrong network. if it is ropsten then change into localhost:7545
